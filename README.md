Like my previous encoding project but actually likely finishedable. Also in C++.  
Now with encoding and decoding options.  
Saving codes has arrived. Create code legends, store, and even reopen previous codes.

Super cool.

JSON functionality uses [nholmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)  

Unfortunately Windows is not currently supported, the program has only been tested inside Clion with Linux. Compatibility *may* be added.
