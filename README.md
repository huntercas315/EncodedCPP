# EncodedCPP
Like my previous encoding project but actually likely finishedable. Also in C++.  

Now with encoding and decoding options.  

Saving codes has arrived. Create code legends, store, and even reopen previous codes.

Cool right.  
I know right.  
Super cool.

JSON functionality uses [nholmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)  

Linux should be supported, also macOS, probably Windows.  
Unfortunately only Ubuntu 21.10 has been tested.  

## Instructions to Run
Compile the program somehow?  
Run the setUp.sh if on Linux/macOS or setUp.bat if on Windows.  
Run the program.
